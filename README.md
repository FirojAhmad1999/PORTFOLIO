# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Full-Stack MERN Portfolio with SMTP Email Service

This is a **full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** portfolio project that demonstrates my skills as a developer. The project showcases my work, with a modern, responsive frontend built with React, and a backend powered by Node.js and Express. It also integrates **SMTP email functionality** for sending contact form submissions directly to an email address.

## Features
- **Frontend**: Built with React.js to create a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js for handling API requests, with MongoDB for storing user data and contact form submissions.
- **SMTP Mail Service**: Integrated SMTP mail functionality using Nodemailer to send emails from the contact form.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop views.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures all form fields are completed before submission.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap for styling)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **SMTP Service**: Nodemailer (for sending emails)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Setup and Installation

Follow the steps below to run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FirojAhmad1999/Portfolio.git


2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the client directory and install the frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm install
Then, navigate to the server directory and install the backend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd ../server
npm install
3. Configure SMTP Service
To send emails, configure Nodemailer with your SMTP credentials. Open server/config/nodemailerConfig.js (or wherever you have the configuration) and replace the following fields:

javascript
Copy code
const nodemailer = require("nodemailer");

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: "gmail",  // You can change this to other services like SendGrid
  auth: {
    user: "your-email@gmail.com",  // Your email
    pass: "your-email-password",   // Your email password or an app password
  },
});

module.exports = transporter;
Note: It’s recommended to use an app password or a service like SendGrid instead of your personal email password for security reasons.

4. Run the Application
Start the Backend
In the server folder, start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm start
Start the Frontend
In the client folder, start the frontend application:

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm start
5. Access the Application
Once both the backend and frontend are running, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view your portfolio.

Usage
The Contact Form allows users to submit messages directly from the frontend.
The Nodemailer integration will send the form submissions to the email address configured in the backend.
Folder Structure
The project has the following folder structure:
